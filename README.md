Repository for my "tidy" version of code and figures to accompany **Analyzing Baseball Data with R** by Marchi and Albert 2014

The purpose of this repo is to present the data parsing and figures in a different way. The analyses in the book are fully reproducible, which is **extremely** important. Everything else comes down to personal preference. I made this repo because I wanted to improve my skills with respects to the "tidy" universe of packages. With that said, there are a few points where the tidy code is so much faster or cleaner than I will draw your attention to it. 

The "tidy" paradigm (aka "tidy-verse" formerly the "Hadley-verse") is just one way of working with data and making figures. The book does a good job presenting concepts and analyses, I just wanted to present a different way of doing many of the same things. Here, I use the *dply* package whenever possible to work with and manipulate data. I also used *ggplot2* to generate figures. 

All data (and the original code) are available on github here: **https://github.com/maxtoki/baseball_R**

I will be downloading the data remotely so the repo is not filled with large files. If you are following along at home you may want to clone the repo or download the data locally.
