Repository for my "tidy" version of code and figures to accompany **Analyzing Baseball Data with R** by Marchi and Albert 2014

The purpose of this repo is to present the data parsing and figures in a different way. The analyses in the book are fully reproducible, which is **extremely** important. Everything else comes down to personal preference. I made this repo because I wanted to improve my skills with respects to the "tidy" universe of packages.

The "tidy" paradigm (aka "tidy-verse" formerly the "Hadley-verse") is just one way of working with data and making figures. The book does a good job presenting concepts and analyses, I just wanted to present a different way of doing many of the same things. Here, I use the *dply* package whenever possible to work with and manipulate data. I also use *ggplot2* to generate figures.
