description: "The purpose of this repo "book" is to present the data parsing and figures from Marchi and Albert in a different way. The analyses in the book are fully reproducible, which is **extremely** important. Everything else comes down to personal preference. This updated format is really for me to learn `bookdown`. This is in no way, shape, or form a copy of the book *Analyzing Baseball Data with* `R`."
